help
help <topic>

Use the help command to get a detailed description on a topic. If you
type help by itself you will get this page. <topic> can be a command,
a zone, a skill, an unrecognized unit of terminology, or anything for
which a help file has been written.

Help files can be found, edited, and created in the help/ directory
of the mud.

The help command was the first command to have a help file.
