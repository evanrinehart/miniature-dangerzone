This is a hobby MUD written mostly in Lua.

It features an custom transactional database with on-disk log and a
non-telnet interface intended to be used through a browser via a
websocket-based client.

Zones are represented as files on the disk and are intended to be
edited live and reloaded from inside the running server. This never
causes a loss of objects.

Currently it has very little in the way of an actual world or gameplay.
