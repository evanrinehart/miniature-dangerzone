A Tunnel

You're in a small tunnel going north and south. This is a test of the
rooms file format. This is the end of the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph. It can extend any number of lines in the
file but will be joined during the load process. Two newlines will
separate paragraphs for the sake of room description loading.

Continuing north you see a test of the zone linkage. It should link
to some part of midgaard.
